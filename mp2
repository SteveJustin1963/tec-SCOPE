Storing precision in groups of integers, often referred to as fixed-point arithmetic, can be a way to maintain better accuracy than using plain 16-bit integers for certain calculations, especially when dealing with fractional values. Fixed-point arithmetic allows you to represent fractional numbers with a fixed number of integer bits and fractional bits. This approach can help you maintain precision while using integer-based data types.

Here's how you might apply fixed-point arithmetic to the provided code:

1. **Choose a Fixed-Point Format**: Determine how many bits you want to allocate for the integer part and how many bits for the fractional part of your fixed-point numbers. This allocation depends on the required precision for your calculations. For example, you might use a Q16.16 format, which uses 16 bits for the integer part and 16 bits for the fractional part.

2. **Scale Values**: Scale your input values (e.g., angles) and constants accordingly. When you read input values like degrees, convert them to your fixed-point format by multiplying them by a suitable scaling factor (e.g., 2^16 for Q16.16).

3. **Perform Calculations**: Perform calculations using fixed-point arithmetic. When multiplying or dividing fixed-point numbers, consider the scaling factor. For example, when multiplying two Q16.16 fixed-point numbers, you would scale the result down by shifting right by 16 bits.

4. **Convert Back**: When you need to display or use the results, convert them back to their original units by reversing the scaling factor.

Here's an example of how you might modify the code to use Q16.16 fixed-point arithmetic:

```forth
\ Declare variables with Q16.16 fixed-point format
16 variable azimuth
16 variable altitude
16 variable latitude
16 variable longitude
16 variable julianDate
16 variable ut
32 variable hourangle  \ Q16.16 format (16 bits integer, 16 bits fractional)
32 variable declination  \ Q16.16 format
32 variable lst  \ Q16.16 format
32 variable rightascension  \ Q16.16 format

\ Constants in Q16.16 format
32768 constant Q_PI

\ Function to convert degrees to Q16.16 fixed-point
: toFixedPoint ( n -- n*Q16.16 )
    32768 * ;

\ Function to convert Q16.16 fixed-point to degrees
: fromFixedPoint ( n -- n/Q16.16 )
    32768 / ;

\ ... (Rest of your code remains mostly the same)

: toRadians ( 16 -- 32 )
    Q_PI * 180 16* 16/ ;

\ ... (Modify other functions as needed)

\ Perform calculations using fixed-point arithmetic
: calculate-declination ( -- )
    latitude @ fsin
    altitude @ fsin *
    latitude @ fcos
    altitude @ fcos *
    azimuth @ fcos *
    f+ f+ 
    fsin
    declination ! ;

\ ... (Modify other functions as needed)

\ Run the main function
main
```

In this modified code, the `toFixedPoint` function scales input values to the Q16.16 format, and the `fromFixedPoint` function converts results back to degrees when displaying them. The `hourangle`, `declination`, `lst`, and `rightascension` variables are declared with 32 bits to accommodate the fixed-point format.

Using fixed-point arithmetic in this manner allows you to maintain better precision than using plain 16-bit integers for calculations involving fractional values. However, it requires careful handling of scaling factors and conversions between fixed-point and real-world units.
