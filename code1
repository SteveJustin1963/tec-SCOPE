 

Variables:
- pulse-count-x: Cumulative pulse count for X axis
- pulse-count-y: Cumulative pulse count for Y axis
- sample-count: Number of samples taken

Counting Pulses:
- Start counting pulses concurrently for 2 seconds on port 1 for X axis and port 2 for Y axis
- Store the cumulative pulse count in pulse-count-x and pulse-count-y respectively
- Increment the sample-count variable for each sample taken

Calibration:
- calibrate-0: Set pulse-count-x and pulse-count-y to 0, execute calibration at 0 degrees on port A for each axis, provide detailed instructions for manual calibration or specify the automatic calibration process
- calibrate-90: Set pulse-count-x and pulse-count-y to 0, execute calibration at 90 degrees on port A for each axis, provide detailed instructions for manual calibration or specify the automatic calibration process
- After calibration, provide feedback to confirm the process was successful

Calculate Angle:
- Calculate the average pulse count per second for X axis: pulse-count-x / sample-count
- Calculate the average pulse count per second for Y axis: pulse-count-y / sample-count
- Reset sample-count to 0
- Scale the pulse count to frequency per second for each axis
- Calculate the angle based on the frequency value for each axis
- Store the calculated angle for X axis in the angle-x variable
- Store the calculated angle for Y axis in the angle-y variable

Sending Angle:
- Send the angle-x value over serial port B at an appropriate baud rate based on the size of the data and the rate of sending required
- Send the angle-y value over serial port B at the same rate

Out of Range:
- Check if the pulse count for X axis is below 0 or above 90
- If so, output a detailed error message to port C for X axis
- Check if the pulse count for Y axis is below 0 or above 90
- If so, output a detailed error message to port C for Y axis

Main Program:
- Perform calibration at 0 degrees for X axis and start counting pulses for 2 seconds
- Perform calibration at 0 degrees for Y axis and start counting pulses for 2 seconds
- Perform calibration at 90 degrees for X axis and start counting pulses for 2 seconds
- Perform calibration at 90 degrees for Y axis and start counting pulses for 2 seconds
- Calculate the angle based on the averaged pulse count for X and Y axes
- Send the angle values over serial port B for X and Y axes
- Check for out-of-range conditions for X and Y axes
- Add exception handling for communication faults or calibration failures
