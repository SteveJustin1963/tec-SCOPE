Az Istenek áldásával. In dedication to my late father, uram, Jusztin Istvan (Stephen Justin) 1932-2000, and his first passage into astronomy back in the 1940s Kiskunfélegyháza Magyarország (Hungary). He made his own telescope by hand, an 8 inch reflector with his friends. He emigrated to Australia in 1962 and by 1976 when I was 13 years old, after seeing a TV week advertisement "Make your own telescope! ... Astro Optical, Clarke Lane, Crows Nest, Sydney, NSW, Australia", I asked my father for us to make a telescope. Three years later we proudly finished our 12.5 inch reflector telescope, the "Fény-Vödör" (Light-Bucket). I also proudly acknowledge "Kiskunfélegyházi Csillagászati Egyesület", the local astronomy club in Kiskunfélegyháza HU.

Now 42 years later I hope to control my old telescope with the TEC-1 and MINT code and with Stellarium's planetarium maps thru a serial port.
