### forward

Az Istenek áldásával and in dedication to my late father, uram Jusztin Istvan (Stephen Justin) Born 1932- RIP 2000, from Kiskunfélegyháza Magyarország Hungary, who later emigrated to Australia in 1962. His passage into astronomy was in the late 1940s, he hand made an 8 inch reflector telescope with his friends. Much later in 1976 when I was 13 years old, I saw a repeating advert in the TV week "Make your own telescope! by Astro Optical at Clarke Lane, Crows Nest, Sydney, NSW, Australia". My dad took interest and 3 years later we finished building a 12.5 inch Fény-Vödör reflector telescope. Id like to acknowledge Kiskunfélegyházi Csillagászati Egyesület; the local astronomy club in Kiskunfélegyháza. Now 42 years later I hope to control this old telescope with a TEC-1, MINT and Stellarium star maps.    


### scope

 project that involves using rotary encoders to read and control a telescope. I wrote some code to convert the encoder data into map data, which I then sent to Stellerium.   

22.9.22

investigate counter with flipflop cct to count rotary encoder movement without resorting to interrupts to count. investigate dc vs steppers. checked LX200 ascii codes.
checked io port options.
