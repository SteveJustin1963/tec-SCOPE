Az Istenek áldásával and in dedication to my late father, uram Jusztin Istvan (Stephen Justin) Born 1932- RIP 2000, from Kiskunfélegyháza Magyarország Hungary, who later emigrated to Australia in 1962. His passage into astronomy was in the late 1940s, he hand made a 8 inch reflector telescope with his friends. Much later in 1976 when I was 13 years old, I saw a repeating advert in the TV week "Make your own telescope! by Astro Optical at Clarke Lane, Crows Nest, Sydney, NSW, Australia". My dad took interest and 3 years later we finished building a 12.5 inch Fény-Vödör reflector telescope. I also acknowledge Kiskunfélegyházi Csillagászati Egyesület; the local astronomy club in Kiskunfélegyháza. Now 42 years later I hope to control the old telescope with a TEC-1 runing MINT and with Stellarium planetarium maps.
