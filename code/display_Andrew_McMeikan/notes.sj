This is a C program consisting of three functions 
main(), scrollDisplay(), and scanDisplay(), and a lookup table digitLookup().

The main() function is the entry point of the program. 
It initializes a counter variable i, and then enters a loop that runs 10,000 times. 
In each iteration of the loop, it calls the scrollDisplay() function and passes a string argument 
"TEC-1 SCROLL 0123456789ABCDEF01234". 

After 10,000 iterations, the program returns from main().

The scrollDisplay() function is responsible for scrolling the input string across a seven-segment display. 
It first initializes two static variables scancount and offset to 0. 
It then calls the scanDisplay() function with a pointer to the offset-th character of the input string. 
It increments scancount by 1, and if it has reached a threshold of 100, 
it resets scancount to 0 and updates the offset by 1 
if the 7th character from the current offset is not a null character, or resets offset to 0 otherwise.

The scanDisplay() function takes a pointer to a character as input and displays the corresponding character on a seven-segment display. 
It first initializes three static variables display, sound, and j. 
display is an array of 8 unsigned chars representing the digit select lines of the seven-segment display. 
sound is a variable that is not used in this program. 
j is an index variable that keeps track of the current character being displayed. 
The function calls the digitLookup() function to get the seven-segment code for the current character and writes it to the 
seven-segment display using the portOut() function
