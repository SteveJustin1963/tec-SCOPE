This code defines two Forth words: read-io-port and count-pulses.

read-io-port is the same as in the previous example and reads the value from an I/O port at a specified address.

count-pulses takes a single input, the address of the I/O port, and counts the number of pulses on the port for 3 seconds. It stores the result in a variable called A. It then returns the final value of A.

You can use count-pulses as follows:

Copy code
port-address count-pulses .
This will count the number of pulses on the I/O port at the specified address for 3 seconds and print the result to the screen.
