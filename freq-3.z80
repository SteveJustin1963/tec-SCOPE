; Z80 SBC Code to Measure Frequency on Port 06 (Bit 1)
; Frequency Range: 200 to 1000 Hz

; Define equates for I/O ports
PORT06  EQU 6    ; Port 06 address

; Define memory locations for variables
FreqCount EQU 0x8000 ; Memory location to store frequency count

; Start of program
START:
    LD  A, 0       ; Clear accumulator
    OUT (PORT06), A ; Reset port 06
    CALL DELAY_MS  ; Delay to ensure a stable starting point
LOOP:
    CALL READ_BIT  ; Read bit 1 from Port 06
    JR  Z, WAIT_LOW ; Wait for a low-to-high transition
WAIT_HIGH:
    CALL READ_BIT  ; Read bit 1 from Port 06
    JR  NZ, WAIT_HIGH ; Wait for a high-to-low transition
    CALL MEASURE   ; Measure the frequency
    JP  LOOP       ; Repeat the loop

; Subroutine to read bit 1 from Port 06
READ_BIT:
    IN  A, (PORT06)
    BIT 1, A       ; Isolate bit 1
    RET

; Subroutine to measure frequency
MEASURE:
    LD  HL, 0      ; Clear HL to store time count
START_TIMER:
    ; Note: Assuming HL increments represent a known time interval
WAIT_LOW:
    CALL READ_BIT  ; Read bit 1 from Port 06
    JR  Z, WAIT_LOW ; Wait until it goes low
WAIT_HIGH:
    INC HL         ; Increment timer count (HL)
    CALL READ_BIT  ; Read bit 1 from Port 06
    JR  NZ, WAIT_HIGH ; Wait until it goes high
STOP_TIMER:
    LD  (FreqCount), HL ; Store the HL value to memory location FreqCount
    ; Compute frequency based on the count in HL and your timer resolution
    ; Conversion logic would go here
    RET

; Subroutine to create a 1ms delay
DELAY_MS:
    LD  DE, 0x1000 ; Load DE with a delay value (adjust as needed)
DELAY_LOOP:
    DEC DE         ; Decrement DE
    LD  A, D
    OR  E          ; Check if DE is zero
    JR  NZ, DELAY_LOOP ; If not zero, continue looping
    RET
