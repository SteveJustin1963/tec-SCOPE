**Differences Between the Two MINT Code Versions**

---

**Introduction:**

The two MINT code versions provided aim to read from a differential encoder attached to a telescope and calculate the altitude in degrees, minutes, and seconds. However, the second version includes additional requirements and adjustments based on your latest instructions:

1. **Interrupt Handling:** The code now handles interrupts to update the altitude only when the telescope moves, allowing the main program to perform other tasks when the telescope is stationary.

2. **Encoder Specifications Adjustment:** The encoder outputs 600 pulses per 360 degrees, but with a 10:1 gearing, it effectively produces 6000 pulses per 360 degrees. The code adjusts calculations to accommodate this change.

---

**Key Differences:**

1. **Implementation of Interrupt Handling:**

   - **First Version:**
     - The initial code continuously polls the encoder signals within an infinite loop to update the altitude.
     - It occupies the processor entirely with reading encoder inputs and calculating the angle, leaving no room for other tasks.

   - **Second Version:**
     - Introduces an interrupt handler using MINT's interrupt handling mechanism (`:Z ... ;`).
     - The encoder circuitry raises an interrupt signal when movement is detected, triggering the interrupt handler.
     - The main program enters an infinite loop where it can perform other tasks, only updating the altitude when an interrupt occurs.

   **Benefits of the Second Version:**

   - **Efficiency:** The processor is not constantly polling the encoder signals, freeing it up for other operations when the telescope is stationary.
   - **Responsiveness:** The altitude is updated immediately upon movement due to interrupt-driven execution.

2. **Adjustment for Encoder Resolution:**

   - **First Version:**
     - Assumes a certain pulses per degree value (e.g., `100` pulses per degree).
     - Calculates the maximum pulse count for 90 degrees based on this assumption.

   - **Second Version:**
     - Updates the pulses per degree to reflect the new encoder resolution:
       - The encoder outputs `600` pulses per 360 degrees, but with 10:1 gearing, it outputs `6000` pulses per 360 degrees.
       - This translates to `1500` pulses per 90 degrees (since `6000 / 4 = 1500`).
     - Adjusts the calculations and scaling factors to accommodate the higher resolution.

   **Benefits of the Second Version:**

   - **Accuracy:** Reflects the actual encoder resolution, ensuring correct altitude calculations.
   - **Scalability:** Adjusts calculations based on the gearing and encoder specifications.

3. **Code Structure and Flow:**

   - **First Version:**

     - **Main Loop:**
       - Uses an infinite loop (`/U (`) that continuously reads encoder signals.
       - Decodes the quadrature signals and updates the pulse count.
       - Converts the pulse count to degrees, minutes, and seconds.
       - Outputs the angle repeatedly.

   - **Second Version:**

     - **Interrupt Handler (`:Z ... ;`):**
       - Contains the logic to read encoder signals, decode them, update the pulse count, and calculate the angle.
       - Is only executed when an interrupt occurs (i.e., when the telescope moves).

     - **Main Program:**
       - Enters an infinite loop where other tasks can be performed.
       - In the example, it prints a message and includes a wait loop to simulate processing time.

   **Benefits of the Second Version:**

   - **Separation of Concerns:** Interrupt handler deals with encoder updates; main program handles other tasks.
   - **Resource Utilization:** Optimizes processor usage by avoiding unnecessary polling.

4. **Quadrature Decoding and Pulse Counting:**

   - **Similarities:**
     - Both versions use the same quadrature decoding mechanism with a direction array to determine movement direction.
     - Update the pulse count based on the decoded direction.

   - **Differences:**
     - The second version includes pulse count clamping to ensure `c` stays within `0` and the maximum count `m` (for 0 to 90 degrees).

   **Benefits of the Second Version:**

   - **Robustness:** Prevents the pulse count from exceeding physical limits, which could lead to incorrect angle calculations.

5. **Angle Calculation Adjustments:**

   - **First Version:**

     - Uses a simpler calculation based on the initial pulses per degree assumption.

   - **Second Version:**

     - Adjusts the calculation to account for the new encoder resolution.
     - Introduces scaling factors (`f_d` and `f_div`) to perform integer arithmetic without loss of precision.

   **Example Calculations:**

   - **Degrees Calculation:**

     ```mint
     // First Version (assuming 100 pulses per degree)
     c e / d !

     // Second Version (with scaling factors)
     c f_d * d !
     d f_div / deg !
     ```

   - **Explanation:**

     - **First Version:** Directly divides the pulse count by pulses per degree.
     - **Second Version:** Multiplies `c` by a factor (`f_d`) and divides by another factor (`f_div`) to accommodate the higher pulse count.

   **Benefits of the Second Version:**

   - **Precision:** Maintains accuracy with higher pulse counts using integer arithmetic.
   - **Adaptability:** Factors can be adjusted if the encoder resolution or gearing changes.

6. **Output Frequency:**

   - **First Version:**

     - Continuously outputs the angle in each loop iteration, which could lead to redundant calculations when the telescope is stationary.

   - **Second Version:**

     - Outputs the angle only when an interrupt occurs (i.e., when movement is detected), reducing unnecessary computations and outputs.

   **Benefits of the Second Version:**

   - **Efficiency:** Reduces processor load and console output when there is no movement.
   - **Clarity:** Outputs are directly tied to actual changes in telescope position.

7. **Main Program Flexibility:**

   - **First Version:**

     - The main program is fully occupied with reading the encoder and updating the angle, leaving no room for additional tasks.

   - **Second Version:**

     - The main program is free to perform other tasks in its loop since the angle updates are handled by the interrupt handler.

   **Benefits of the Second Version:**

   - **Multitasking:** Allows the telescope control system to handle additional responsibilities, such as user input, data logging, or communication with other devices.

**Summary of Benefits in the Second Version:**

- **Interrupt-Driven Updates:** Efficiently updates the altitude only when necessary, conserving processing power.
- **Adjusted Calculations:** Accurately reflects the increased encoder resolution due to the 10:1 gearing.
- **Processor Availability:** Frees up the main program to perform other operations when the telescope is stationary.
- **Improved Accuracy:** Ensures pulse counts and angle calculations are precise and within expected ranges.
- **Optimized Resource Utilization:** Minimizes unnecessary computations and outputs.

**Potential Considerations:**

1. **Hardware Interrupt Configuration:**

   - Ensure that the encoder's output is connected to the appropriate interrupt line on the Z80 microprocessor.
   - The interrupt signal should be configured to trigger on encoder pulses.

2. **Interrupt Handler Performance:**

   - The interrupt handler should be as efficient as possible to prevent delays or missed interrupts, especially if the telescope moves rapidly.

3. **Shared Resources:**

   - Be cautious with variables shared between the main program and the interrupt handler to avoid race conditions or data corruption.
   - Consider implementing synchronization mechanisms if necessary.

4. **Testing and Debugging:**

   - Testing the interrupt-driven code may require hardware that can generate interrupts.
   - Simulate encoder signals and interrupts during testing to validate the program's functionality before deploying on actual hardware.

**Conclusion:**

The second version of the MINT code is an enhancement over the first, addressing your updated requirements by incorporating interrupt handling and adjusting for the encoder's new specifications due to gearing. It offers improved efficiency, accuracy, and resource utilization, making it better suited for your telescope altitude measurement application.
