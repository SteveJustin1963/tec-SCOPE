Certainly! Here's a high-level explanation of the provided Forth code:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The code begins by defining memory locations and constants for storing pulse-related information, such as the start time and duration.
   - It also defines a constant for the I/O port address used to read the pulse input.
   - Memory locations for pulse-related variables are initialized to zero.

2. **Waiting for Rising Edge**:
   - The code enters a loop that waits for a rising edge on the pulse input. It continually checks the input port until a rising edge is detected (a change from low to high).

3. **Recording Start Time**:
   - When a rising edge is detected, the code calls a subroutine (`GET-CURRENT-TIME`) to get the current time or timer value. It then stores this time as the pulse start time.

4. **Waiting for Falling Edge**:
   - After recording the start time, the code enters another loop that waits for a falling edge on the pulse input (a change from high to low).

5. **Calculating Pulse Duration**:
   - When a falling edge is detected, the code calls the `calculate-pulse-duration` subroutine.
   - This subroutine calculates the pulse duration by subtracting the pulse start time from the current time.
   - The calculated duration is then stored in the `pulse_duration` variable.

6. **Main Loop**:
   - The code repeats the process, continuously monitoring the input for changes in the pulse signal, recording start times, and calculating durations.
   - You can add further processing or output as needed within this loop.

7. **Entry Point**:
   - The `main-loop` word is called to start the program execution.

Overall, this code is designed to measure the duration of pulses in an input signal, recording the start time when a rising edge is detected and calculating the duration when a falling edge is detected. The duration values are stored in memory variables for further use or processing.
