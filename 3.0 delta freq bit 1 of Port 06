1. The program starts by clearing the accumulator `A` and resetting Port 06 to zero. 
It then introduces a 1 ms delay using the `DELAY_MS` subroutine to ensure a stable starting point.

2. The main loop labeled `LOOP` is where the frequency measurement occurs. It repeatedly checks 
the signal on bit 1 of Port 06.

3. The `READ_BIT` subroutine reads bit 1 from Port 06 and returns the result in the `A` register.

4. The `MEASURE` subroutine is responsible for measuring the frequency. It uses the `HL` register 
pair as a simple timer counter. Here's how it works:

   - `START_TIMER`: This marks the start of the timer operation.
   - `WAIT_LOW`: It waits for the signal on bit 1 to go low.
   - `WAIT_HIGH`: While the signal is high, it increments the `HL` register (acting as a timer).
   - `STOP_TIMER`: When the signal goes from high to low, it stores the value of `HL` in the memory
location `FreqCount`. This value represents the time elapsed while the signal was high.

5. After stopping the timer, the code would typically include logic to convert the time count in 
`FreqCount` to frequency based on the timer resolution. This conversion logic is not provided in 
the code but should be implemented according to your specific timer configuration.

6. The program then repeats the measurement by jumping back to the `LOOP` label.

Please note that this code relies on the assumption that the incrementing of the `HL` register 
represents a known time interval, which can be used to calculate the frequency. The accuracy and
resolution of the measurement depend on the timer resolution and the frequency of the input signal.

For more accurate and efficient frequency measurement, it is recommended to use dedicated timer 
hardware or the Z80's built-in timers, if available, rather than relying solely on software-based timing.
